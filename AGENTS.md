# AGENTS.md

## Project purpose
This repository builds and runs a reproducible multi-agent reviewer for academic economics papers.

The normal workflow is:
1. Put source PDFs in `inputs/`.
2. Preprocess each paper into structured artifacts under `work/<paper_id>/parsed/`.
3. Run specialized reviewer agents on the parsed artifacts.
4. Store reviewer JSON outputs under `work/<paper_id>/reviews/`.
5. Compile the final markdown report under `outputs/<paper_id>/report.md`.

## Canonical file locations
- Source PDFs: `inputs/`
- Parsed artifacts: `work/<paper_id>/parsed/`
- Reviewer outputs: `work/<paper_id>/reviews/`
- Final reports: `outputs/<paper_id>/`

## Path conventions
- If the user refers to `paper1.pdf`, first resolve it as `inputs/paper1.pdf`.
- Prefer project-relative paths over absolute paths when possible.
- Do not assume a file is outside the repo unless the user explicitly says so.

## Workflow rules
- Never run reviewer agents directly on a raw PDF if parsed artifacts do not exist.
- Preprocessing comes before review.
- Internal reviewer agents return structured JSON only.
- Only the editor writes the final markdown report.
- If preprocessing artifacts are missing or clearly poor, fail clearly instead of guessing.

## Preprocessing rules
- Preserve original page numbering.
- Normalize whitespace carefully.
- Never silently remove minus signs, decimal points, percent symbols, parentheses, or appendix labels.
- Save page-level outputs and inventories so downstream reviewers can cite locations precisely.
- Use OCR only when text extraction clearly fails or the PDF is scanned/image-only.

## Reviewer rules
- Literature and reference verification require web search when enabled.
- Never guess missing evidence; use `cannot_verify` or equivalent failure labels.
- Preserve exact source locations whenever possible.
- Keep reviewer outputs modular so failed reviewers can be rerun independently.

## Working style
- Prefer deterministic scripts for file handling, preprocessing, validation, and report assembly.
- Use Codex for judgment-heavy auditing and synthesis tasks.
- Keep the workflow reproducible, inspectable, and easy to rerun.
