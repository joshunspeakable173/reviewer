# Reviewer

A local, Windows-first Codex project for building and testing a multi-agent reviewer for academic economics papers.

This repo is both:
- a real workflow for paper review, and
- a learning project for using Codex in a disciplined, reproducible way.

The goal is not to build a polished product immediately. The goal is to learn a workflow with repo guidance, project-scoped config, custom agents, repo-scoped skills, `codex exec`, JSON schemas, deterministic preprocessing, validation, and editor synthesis.

Current status: the pipeline was first proven manually on `inputs/paper1.pdf`, and `scripts/review_paper.py` has passed end-to-end smoke tests on both `paper1` and `paper2`. The generated reviewer JSON files validated, the normalized editor bundles were built, the editor produced final markdown reports, and the reports passed `scripts/check_final_report.py`.

## Mental Model

The repo has several layers. They do different jobs.

- `AGENTS.md`: repo-wide guidance for Codex.
- `.codex/config.toml`: project-level Codex defaults.
- `.codex/agents/*.toml`: custom reviewer/editor definitions.
- `.agents/skills/paper-reviewer/SKILL.md`: reusable workflow playbook.
- `config/reviewers.json`: configured reviewer roster.
- `prompts/templates/*.txt`: reusable prompt templates.
- `schemas/*.json`: structured output contracts.
- `scripts/*.py`: deterministic machinery for preprocessing, validation, normalization, and orchestration.

A useful shorthand:
- agents = workers
- reviewer config = roster and run options
- skills = playbooks
- schemas = output contracts
- prompt templates = assignment patterns
- scripts = deterministic glue

## Why Preprocessing Comes First

For PDF-heavy review work, bad extraction is usually the largest source of downstream error.

The intended flow is:
1. preprocess the PDF into structured artifacts
2. render run-specific prompts
3. run reviewer agents on parsed artifacts
4. validate reviewer JSON
5. normalize and deduplicate reviewer outputs
6. build editor input
7. run the editor
8. write the final markdown report
9. smoke-check the final report

For fresh runs, `scripts/review_paper.py` is the default entry point for this flow.

## What Lives Where

### `inputs/`

Source PDFs. Usually not committed to Git.

Example:

```text
inputs/paper1.pdf
```

### `work/`

Intermediate artifacts. Usually not committed to Git.

Examples:
- parsed page text and images
- extracted tables and figures
- rendered prompts
- reviewer JSON outputs
- normalized editor bundles
- generated editor input

### `outputs/`

Final human-readable reports. Usually not committed to Git.

### `prompts/templates/`

Reusable prompt templates tracked in Git. They should not hardcode `paper1`.

Run-specific prompt files are generated under:

```text
work/<paper_id>/prompts/
```

### `config/reviewers.json`

The enabled reviewer roster. Each reviewer entry declares the Codex agent name, prompt template, output filename, whether web search is required, and the normalizer role used during editor-bundle construction.

Valid `normalization_role` values are:
- `manuscript`: default substantive manuscript findings
- `crossref`: cross-reference findings, including parser-artifact classification for parser/false-positive categories
- `reference`: reference-integrity findings, including bibliography-maintenance classification for outdated or metadata-typo categories

### `schemas/`

JSON schemas used for stable reviewer outputs.

### `scripts/`

Deterministic workflow steps.

Current scripts:
- `preprocess_pdf.py`
- `validate_review_json.py`
- `render_prompts.py`
- `normalize_review_outputs.py`
- `build_editor_input.py`
- `check_final_report.py`
- `review_paper.py`

To add another reviewer, add `.codex/agents/<name>.toml`, add a matching prompt template under `prompts/templates/`, and add one enabled entry to `config/reviewers.json`.

## Environment Assumptions

This repo currently assumes:
- Windows
- PowerShell
- local Git
- local Python virtual environment at `.venv`
- Codex CLI available in the shell

Typical start:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\s11378\Dropbox\reviewer
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
git status
```

## Current Best-Practice Workflow

For a fully automated fresh run, use:

```powershell
python scripts\review_paper.py --pdf inputs\paper2.pdf
```

This derives `paper_id` from the PDF filename, writes intermediate artifacts under `work/<paper_id>/`, writes the final report to `outputs/<paper_id>/report.md`, and stores subprocess logs under `work/<paper_id>/logs/`.

Use an explicit paper ID when needed:

```powershell
python scripts\review_paper.py --pdf inputs\paper2.pdf --paper-id paper2
```

The wrapper currently runs a fresh pipeline and executes the configured reviewers in parallel. It has passed end-to-end smoke tests on `paper1` and `paper2`. The manual steps below remain useful for debugging or rerunning one stage by hand.

### 1. Preprocess

```powershell
python scripts\preprocess_pdf.py --pdf inputs\paper1.pdf
```

This writes parsed artifacts under:

```text
work/paper1/parsed/
```

### 2. Render Prompts

```powershell
python scripts\render_prompts.py `
  --paper-id paper1 `
  --parsed-dir work\paper1\parsed `
  --reviews-dir work\paper1\reviews `
  --schema-path schemas\reviewer_output.schema.json `
  --output-dir work\paper1\prompts
```

### 3. Run Reviewers

The default reviewer agents are configured in `config/reviewers.json`:
- `crossref_auditor`
- `numerical_auditor`
- `claim_evidence_auditor`
- `literature_auditor`
- `reference_auditor`

Each reviewer reads from `work/<paper_id>/parsed/` and writes one JSON file under `work/<paper_id>/reviews/`.

The basic command shape is:

```powershell
Get-Content work\paper1\prompts\crossref_audit.txt -Raw |
  codex exec --output-schema schemas\reviewer_output.schema.json `
    --output-last-message work\paper1\reviews\crossref_auditor.json `
    -
```

For search-enabled reviewers, use the CLI search form supported by the installed Codex version, for example:

```powershell
codex --search exec ...
```

### 4. Validate Reviewer JSON

```powershell
python scripts\validate_review_json.py --schema schemas\reviewer_output.schema.json --input work\paper1\reviews\crossref_auditor.json
```

Repeat for all configured reviewer outputs.

### 5. Normalize and Deduplicate

```powershell
python scripts\normalize_review_outputs.py `
  --paper-id paper1 `
  --reviews-dir work\paper1\reviews `
  --output work\paper1\editor\normalized_bundle.json
```

The normalized bundle groups overlapping findings, separates parser artifacts from manuscript issues, and removes process notes from editor-facing synthesis.

### 6. Build Editor Input

```powershell
python scripts\build_editor_input.py `
  --paper-id paper1 `
  --editor-prompt work\paper1\prompts\editor_report.txt `
  --bundle work\paper1\editor\normalized_bundle.json `
  --reviews-dir work\paper1\reviews `
  --output work\paper1\editor\editor_input.md
```

### 7. Run Editor

```powershell
Get-Content work\paper1\editor\editor_input.md -Raw |
  codex exec --output-last-message outputs\paper1\report.md -
```

The editor must write the actual final markdown report, not a note saying where the report was saved.
The report must include traceability lines with canonical and source finding IDs, such as:

```markdown
**Traceability:** CANON-001; source finding(s): claim_evidence_auditor:CEA-005
```

### 8. Check Final Report

```powershell
python scripts\check_final_report.py --input outputs\paper1\report.md
```

The final report checker rejects reports that are too short, look like run-status notes, omit required headings, or omit canonical/source finding identifiers.

## Lessons Learned

- Saved prompt templates are better than one-off interactive prompts.
- Schemas and validation are more reliable than repeated "return JSON only" instructions.
- The reviewer stage is useful, but the editor needs deterministic help.
- Normalization before editor synthesis is worth doing.
- Final reports need traceability identifiers, not just readable prose, so findings can be traced back to reviewer outputs.
- PowerShell `>` redirection is risky for JSON outputs on Windows; prefer `--output-last-message`.
- The wrapper script preserves the proven sequence and runs reviewer jobs in parallel.
- A second-paper smoke test is valuable because it catches stale assumptions that a single proof run can hide; `paper2` now gives the wrapper that broader check.

## Git Hygiene

Usually track:
- `AGENTS.md`
- `.codex/config.toml`
- `.codex/agents/*.toml`
- `.agents/skills/paper-reviewer/SKILL.md`
- `config/reviewers.json`
- `prompts/templates/*.txt`
- `schemas/*.json`
- `scripts/*.py`
- `requirements.txt`
- `.gitignore`
- `README.md`
- `CODEX_REVIEW_PROMPT.md`
- `PIPELINE_STATUS.md`

Usually do not track:
- `inputs/*.pdf`
- `work/`
- `outputs/`
- `.venv/`

The rule of thumb is: track the machine that produces the results, not the temporary products.
