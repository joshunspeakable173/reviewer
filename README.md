# Reviewer

A reproducible multi-agent reviewer for academic economics papers. The repository contains the workflow machinery: preprocessing scripts, reviewer prompts, schemas, validation, normalization, editor assembly, tests, and Codex project instructions. It does not include papers or generated review outputs.

The main entry point is:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\review_paper.py --pdf "inputs\<paper_id>.pdf"
```

On macOS/Linux, use `./.venv/bin/python` instead of `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe`.

## What This Does

For a fresh paper, the wrapper:

1. preprocesses the PDF into structured artifacts under `work/<paper_id>/parsed/`
2. renders run-specific prompts under `work/<paper_id>/prompts/`
3. runs parser-quality preflight before substantive review
4. dynamically selects optional reviewers while always running mandatory reviewers
5. validates every reviewer JSON output against schema and semantic checks
6. normalizes and deduplicates reviewer findings into an editor bundle
7. builds editor input from the normalized bundle and original reviewer JSON files
8. runs the editor to write `outputs/<paper_id>/report.md`
9. smoke-checks final report structure and traceability

Only the project machinery is meant to be shared on GitHub. Source PDFs, parsed artifacts, reviewer logs, and final reports are local/private by default.

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Ingar30/reviewer.git
cd reviewer
```

### 2. Install Prerequisites

You need:

- Python 3.12 or newer
- Git
- Codex CLI installed and authenticated
- access to the model/search features needed by your reviewer configuration

### 3. Set Up Python

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
.\setup.ps1
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

macOS/Linux:

```bash
bash setup.sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Manual setup is also fine:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Check The Install

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\check_environment.py
```

### 5. Add A Paper Locally

Put a source PDF in `inputs/`. Files in `inputs/` are ignored by Git.

```text
inputs/my-paper.pdf
```

### 6. Run A Review

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\review_paper.py --pdf "inputs\my-paper.pdf"
```

The final report will be written to:

```text
outputs/my-paper/report.md
```

The intermediate parsed artifacts, prompts, logs, reviewer outputs, selection output, and editor bundle will be written to:

```text
work/my-paper/
```

## Repository Map

Tracked project machinery:

- `AGENTS.md`: Codex-facing workflow and safety instructions.
- `.codex/config.toml`: project-level Codex defaults.
- `.agents/skills/paper-reviewer/SKILL.md`: reusable workflow playbook.
- `config/reviewers.json`: enabled reviewer roster and reviewer metadata.
- `prompts/templates/*.txt`: reusable prompt templates.
- `schemas/*.json`: structured output contracts.
- `scripts/*.py`: deterministic preprocessing, validation, orchestration, normalization, and report checks.
- `tests/`: focused unit tests for reviewer config, validation, normalization, editor brief behavior, and report checks.
- `.github/`: CI, issue templates, and pull request template.
- `.github/dependabot.yml`: weekly dependency checks for GitHub Actions and Python requirements.
- `setup.ps1` and `setup.sh`: local bootstrap helpers.
- `scripts/check_environment.py`: fast local readiness check for dependencies, project files, and Codex CLI.
- `scripts/check_tracked_sensitive_names.py`: pre-push scanner for unexpected sensitive variable names in shareable files.
- `Slides/`: optional teaching material for explaining the workflow.
- `docs/first_review_walkthrough.md`: step-by-step path for a new user running a first private review.
- `docs/repository_settings.md`: recommended GitHub settings for the private repository.

Local/private runtime locations:

- `inputs/`: source PDFs.
- `work/<paper_id>/parsed/`: parsed page text, page images, inventories, tables, figures, citations, crossrefs, and manifest files.
- `work/<paper_id>/prompts/`: rendered run-specific prompts.
- `work/<paper_id>/selection/`: reviewer selector output and selected reviewer roster.
- `work/<paper_id>/reviews/`: reviewer JSON outputs.
- `work/<paper_id>/editor/`: normalized bundle and editor input.
- `outputs/<paper_id>/report.md`: final human-readable report.

## Privacy And Git Hygiene

Do not commit:

- source PDFs or other paper files
- parsed artifacts under `work/`
- rendered prompts or logs from real papers
- reviewer JSON outputs
- editor bundles
- final reports
- API keys, tokens, passwords, credentials, or authenticated CLI config

The `.gitignore` file is configured to keep `inputs/`, `work/`, and `outputs/` contents local while retaining README placeholders for those directories. Before pushing or making the repository public, inspect tracked files:

```powershell
git ls-files
git status --short
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\check_shareable_repo.py --include-untracked
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\check_tracked_sensitive_names.py
```

See `docs/public_release_checklist.md` before switching the GitHub repository from private to public.

## Reviewer Roster

Reviewers are configured in `config/reviewers.json`. Each entry declares:

- reviewer name
- prompt template
- output filename
- finding ID prefix
- whether search is required
- normalization role
- stage: `preflight` or `review`
- selection policy: `mandatory` or `optional`

Mandatory reviewers currently include parser preflight plus baseline cross-reference, reference, and grammar/copyediting checks. Optional reviewers cover numerical claims, claim-evidence alignment, literature positioning, identification, robustness, sample construction, front/back consistency, external validity, model/equation checks, replication/data availability, institutional context, power/multiple testing, design/randomization, and economic magnitude.

Search-enabled reviewers require Codex search mode. Literature and reference verification should not be guessed; use `cannot_verify` when evidence is missing.

Run all enabled review-stage reviewers without selector filtering:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\review_paper.py --pdf "inputs\my-paper.pdf" --reviewer-selection static
```

Use an explicit paper id when needed:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\review_paper.py --pdf "inputs\my-paper.pdf" --paper-id "my-custom-id"
```

## Editor-Only Refresh

Use editor-only refresh when parsed artifacts, reviewer JSON, selected reviewer config, and `work/<paper_id>/editor/normalized_bundle.json` already exist, and the change only affects editor presentation or report shape.

```powershell
$paperId = "my-paper"

python scripts\render_prompts.py `
  --paper-id $paperId `
  --parsed-dir "work\${paperId}\parsed" `
  --reviews-dir "work\${paperId}\reviews" `
  --schema-path schemas\reviewer_output.schema.json `
  --output-dir "work\${paperId}\prompts" `
  --editor-bundle-path "work\${paperId}\editor\normalized_bundle.json" `
  --reviewers-config "work\${paperId}\selection\selected_reviewers.json"

python scripts\build_editor_input.py `
  --paper-id $paperId `
  --editor-prompt "work\${paperId}\prompts\editor_report.txt" `
  --bundle "work\${paperId}\editor\normalized_bundle.json" `
  --reviews-dir "work\${paperId}\reviews" `
  --output "work\${paperId}\editor\editor_input.md" `
  --reviewers-config "work\${paperId}\selection\selected_reviewers.json"

Get-Content "work\${paperId}\editor\editor_input.md" -Raw |
  codex exec --output-last-message "outputs\${paperId}\report.md" -

python scripts\check_final_report.py `
  --input "outputs\${paperId}\report.md" `
  --bundle "work\${paperId}\editor\normalized_bundle.json"
```

Do not use editor-only refresh when reviewer evidence, parsing, reviewer selection, or normalized findings need to change.

## Output Contracts

Reviewer outputs must conform to `schemas/reviewer_output.schema.json` and semantic checks in `scripts/validate_review_json.py`.

Important reviewer-output expectations:

- stable IDs such as `NUM-001` matching each reviewer `id_prefix`
- explicit `issue_type`, `severity`, and `confidence`
- precise locations when possible
- `source_objects` for verifiable findings
- `cannot_verify_reason` for cannot-verify findings
- `numeric_check` for verifiable numerical-auditor findings
- `claim_evidence_links` when comparing claims with source evidence
- copyediting findings routed as `copyedit_issue`

The final report should be readable prose first, with canonical IDs and source finding IDs collected in `## Appendix: Traceability Map` rather than repeated in body footers. `scripts/check_final_report.py` is a smoke check for structure and traceability coverage; it is not a full semantic audit of every claim or external source.

## Development

Run the test suite:

```powershell
python -m unittest
```

Add a reviewer by adding:

1. `prompts/templates/<prompt>.txt`
2. one enabled entry in `config/reviewers.json`
3. focused tests when the reviewer changes validation, normalization, routing, or report structure

GitHub Actions runs `python -m unittest` on pushes and pull requests to `main` or `master`.

## Current Limitations

- Complex PDFs can still produce scrambled sorted text on some pages.
- Raw-caption fallback is conservative because exact caption/body coordinates are not always available.
- Normalization uses deterministic heuristics and should be revisited as more papers are tested.
- The final report checker verifies shape and identifiers, not the truth of external references.
- Pilot reviewers can add length or overlap if selector cues are too broad.
- Selective rerun/resume support is still manual; use editor-only refresh only when its prerequisites hold.
